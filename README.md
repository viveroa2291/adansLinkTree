My learning was focused on making a simple UI that resembled a linktree with a smooth UX added with a music theme for the page. 

# Optimizations

To improve this website, I plan on 
<ul>
 <li>Faster rendering on the images of the page for the mobile design. It might be complicated because of how it is set up but will be something I will look into.</li>
 <li>Clean up the design on the lenses with the grid layout.</li>
 <li>Implement a round image for my main image of me for the mobile design. Right now there is an oval. </li>
 </ul> 

# Lessons Learned:

<ul>
 <li>Adding a fetch api for the follower count</li>
 <li>A faster rendering for the snapchat feature (I am still figuring out a way to make it faster). </li>
 <li>Applying the grid layout and figuring out some css spacing with the left side of the page. </li>
 <li>Still figuring out a faster rendering for the SVG's in the links.</li>
 <li>An interactive background that gives out a space theme and applying a 3d rotating animation. </li>
</ul>
