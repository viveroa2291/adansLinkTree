My learning was focused on making a simple UI that resembled a linktree with a smooth UX added with a music theme for the page. 

# Optimizations

When I improve this project, I would start by updating the spring and summer animation of rain and fireflies. Currently have fall and winter finished just need to add the other too into the Date checker. Would also like to add some javascript to add gifs to front page.

# Lessons Learned:

<ul>
 <li>Adding a fetch api for the follower count</li>
 <li>A faster rendering for the snapchat feature (I am still figuring out a way to make it faster). </li>
 <li>Applying the grid layout and figuring out some css spacing with the left side of the page. </li>
 <li>Still figuring out a faster rendering for the SVG's in the links.</li>
 <li>An interactive background that gives out a space theme and applying a 3d rotating animation. </li>
</ul>
